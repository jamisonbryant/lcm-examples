# 01. Introduction

"Bot This Way" (sometimes abbreviated "BTW") is a robotics project focused on developing a robot that can follow simple signage along an established route. The route will not be programmed into the robot prior to launch. Instead, the robot must be able to autonomously navigate the route purely by following signs placed by the route-setter with no human interference.
